# FoodCLUB

For the Product Finder feature, we primarily focused on being able to show the user which retailers near them have the products they are looking for. As a result, we hardcoded the user's location and cart. We did add a location manager, as well as the appropriate functions needed to get the user's location. The retailers in our retailers.json each have a made up coordinate with each store being approximately under 5 miles, 10 miles, and 15 miles away from the user.
